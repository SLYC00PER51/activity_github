This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow.
I’m someone who’s always been driven by curiosity and the need to understand how things work. That’s a big part of why I’m pursuing my Associate Degree in IT Software Development — I like taking ideas apart, rebuilding them, and making them cleaner, smarter, or more efficient. Programming gives me that mix of logic and creativity that I’ve always clicked with.
